        "The Bio-Intelligence Systems Lab aims to understand the brain in engineers’\n          manner and to create next-generation brain-like computation systems. Our\n          research field is interdisciplinary, ranging between informatics, engineering,\n          and neuroscience. To reveal how intelligence, consciousness, and fine arts\n          emerge, we investigate neural computation at various scales, ranging from\n          dissociate culture of neurons on a petri dish, the rodent brain, and the\n          human brain. We develop novel experimental methods and equipment, such\n          as high-density microelectrode arrays and behavioral assays, to obtain\n          large-scale experimental data, and make full use of state-of-the-art machine\n          learning and artificial intelligence to characterize and analyze our own\n          data. Based on these experiments, we reveal the dynamics of neural activities\n          and construct mathematical models of the brain."

        "How does intelligence emerge from a neuronal network in the brain? To address\n                this fundamental question, dissociate neuronal culture may inspire us.\n                In the dissociate culture, neurons seeded onto a petri dish form a network\n                in a self-organizing manner. In addition, this neural network flexibly\n                alters the activities depending on external stimuli and developmental age.\n                Such spatio-temporal activity pattern must be helpful to reveal the design\n                principle of these networks.\n                \n                Various innovative technologies are easily applicable in the dissociate\n                culture. For example, we demonstrated that a high-dense CMOS array with\n                10,000 recording sites within 2 x 2 mm2 is able to track the propagation of action potentials within the network.\n                The dissociate culture can be also genetically modified such that photoreceptors\n                and odorant receptors are extrinsically expressed within the network. Such\n                a network may be used as a bio-silicon hybrid sensor.\n                \n                Inspired by recent theoretical advances in the field of reservoir computing,\n                we also attempt to use the neuronal culture as a reservoir. A robot embodied\n                by reservoir computing sometimes exhibits complex, living-organism-like\n                behaviors.\n                Dissociate neuronal culture\n                High-dense CMOS array"

        "Microelectrode arrays\n                \n                How does the brain differ from computers when representing external world?\n                How does our conscious perception emerge in the brain, but not in computers?\n                Unlike transistors in computers, each neuron exhibits heterogeneous characteristics.\n                Now, the largest missing link is how such heterogeneous information is\n                integrated. To address this question, we gather \"big data\" from\n                the cortex in rats with various microelectrode arrays, and analyze them\n                using information theory and machine learning techniques. We also employ\n                behavior experiments to reveal how subjective information such as ongoing\n                conscious perception, preference, emotion, saliency, valence, etc., are\n                encoded in the neural activity patterns of animals.\n                \n                Owing to cutting-edge, high-density mapping of neural activities, we are\n                able to characterize precise, local synchrony patterns in the auditory\n                cortex, and are able to investigate the thalamo-cortical interaction in\n                terms of information transfer. Such 'state' of the brain emerging from\n                interaction between top-down and bottom-up activities are more informative\n                than we thought, offering a future direction in a research field of sensory\n                computation."

        "Epileptic seizure is a disorganized state of the brain. We would like to\n                understand how and why seizures occur, and establish treatments to avoid\n                and control seizures. \n                \n                Taking advantage of intra-cortical, high-density mapping, we are investigating\n                functional networks within the brain of epileptic patients and epileptic\n                model of animals. The network properties exhibit long-term fluctuation,\n                which may be critical to predict seizures and to understand pathological\n                conditions of seizure. Of our particular interest is the vagus nerve stimulation\n                (VNS), which may exert modulation in the cortical synchronous activities.\n                VNS is effective not only for seizure inhibition, but also for enhancement\n                of cognitive performance. Thus, by better understanding the mechanism of\n                actions of VNS as well as the mechanisms of seizure, we may gain insights\n                into cortical computation.\n                \n                Intracortical electrode array for ECoG recording"

D.\nProfessor (PI)\nProfile, Research, Publication\n\nLet us \"reverse engineer\" the brain!\n\nOf our interest is the neural computation in the cerebral cortex. In particular, we measure neural activities with high-dense microelectrode arrays and analyze the spatio-temporal data. As we belong to the mechanical engineering department, we are enjoying neuroscience in mechanical engineers' manner. Our goal is to conceive and extract the design principle of brain from what we see and what we get in experiments, and to re-produce the brain function based on the extracted information. Toward this goal, we are interested in multiple scales of neural networks, ranging from dissociate neuonal culture in petri dishes (in vitro study), thalamo-cortical auditory system in rodents (in vivo study), and cerebral cortex in humans (clinical study).\n\nKeywords: brain, neuroscience, neural engineering, electrophysiology, cerebral cortex, auditory cortex, neural circuits, spatiotemporal activity pattern, perception, audition, auditory streaming, auditory illusion, tinnitus, mismatch negativity (MMN), intelligence, emotion, learning and memory, plasticity, epilepsy, microelectrode array, imaging, local field potential (LFP), electrocorticogram (ECoG), conditioning, behavioral experiment, embodiment, functional map, phase synchrony, brain-machine interface (BMI), cyborg, machine learning, decoding, information theory, transfer entropy, reservoir computing, etc.\nProfile\n\nHirokazu Takahashi was born in Sendai, Japan, in 1975. He received B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in mechanical engineering from the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan, in 1998, 2000, and 2003, respectively. After working as a research associate in Department of Engineering Synthesis, the University of Tokyo, he has joined Department of Mechano-Informatics, the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, the University of Tokyo, as an assistant professor since 2004. In 2006, he has joined the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology. In 2019, he has returned to Department of Mechano-Informatics, the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, as an associate professor, and become a professor in 2023. His current research interests include areas of biomedical engineering ranging from rehabilitation engineering for restoring lost functions to experimental neurophysiology for understanding fundamental brain functions.\n\n\t\nこのページの先頭へ\nCurrent Research Interests\n\nThe Bio-Intelligence Systems Lab aims to understand the brain in engineers’ manner and to create next-generation brain-like computation systems. Our research field is interdisciplinary, ranging between informatics, engineering, and neuroscience. To reveal how intelligence, consciousness, and fine arts emerge, we investigate neural computation at various scales, ranging from dissociate culture of neurons on a petri dish, the rodent brain, and the human brain. We develop novel experimental methods and equipment, such as high-density microelectrode arrays and behavioral assays, to obtain large-scale experimental data, and make full use of state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence to characterize and analyze our own data. Based on these experiments, we reveal the dynamics of neural activities and construct mathematical models of the brain.\n\nEmergent computing (Dissociate neuronal culture)\nHow does intelligence emerge from a neuronal network in the brain? To address this fundamental question, dissociate neuronal culture may inspire us. In the dissociate culture, neurons seeded onto a petri dish form a network in a self-organizing manner. In addition, this neural network flexibly alters the activities depending on external stimuli and developmental age. Such spatio-temporal activity pattern must be helpful to reveal the design principle of these networks.\n\nVarious innovative technologies are easily applicable in the dissociate culture. For example, we demonstrated that a high-dense CMOS array with 10,000 recording sites within 2 x 2 mm2 is able to track the propagation of action potentials within the network. The dissociate culture can be also genetically modified such that photoreceptors and odorant receptors are extrinsically expressed within the network. Such a network may be used as a bio-silicon hybrid sensor.\n\nInspired by recent theoretical advances in the field of reservoir computing, we also attempt to use the neuronal culture as a reservoir. A robot embodied by reservoir computing sometimes exhibits complex, living-organism-like behaviors.\tDissociate neuronal culture\nHigh-dense CMOS array\nCollaborators\n- Prof. Andreas Hierlemann, Dr. Douglas Bakkum (ETH, Zurich) (link)\n- Dr. Urs Frey (Maxwell Biosystems) (link)\n- Prof. Takashi Ikegami (Univ. Tokyo)(link)\nAuditory system (Cortex & thalamus in rodents)\n\nMicroelectrode arrays\n\n\tHow does the brain differ from computers when representing external world? How does our conscious perception emerge in the brain, but not in computers? Unlike transistors in computers, each neuron exhibits heterogeneous characteristics. Now, the largest missing link is how such heterogeneous information is integrated. To address this question, we gather \"big data\" from the cortex in rats with various microelectrode arrays, and analyze them using information theory and machine learning techniques. We also employ behavior experiments to reveal how subjective information such as ongoing conscious perception, preference, emotion, saliency, valence, etc., are encoded in the neural activity patterns of animals.\n\nOwing to cutting-edge, high-density mapping of neural activities, we are able to characterize precise, local synchrony patterns in the auditory cortex, and are able to investigate the thalamo-cortical interaction in terms of information transfer. Such 'state' of the brain emerging from interaction between top-down and bottom-up activities are more informative than we thought, offering a future direction in a research field of sensory computation.\nCollaborators\n- Dr. Shigeto Furukawa, Dr. Makio Kashino (NTT) (link)\n- Prof. Naotsugu Tsuchiya (Monash Univ., Australia) (link)\n- Dr. Haruka Nakahara (Edogawabashi Clinic)(link)\nEpilepsy（Cerebral cortex in rats and humans）\nEpileptic seizure is a disorganized state of the brain. We would like to understand how and why seizures occur, and establish treatments to avoid and control seizures.\n\nTaking advantage of intra-cortical, high-density mapping, we are investigating functional networks within the brain of epileptic patients and epileptic model of animals. The network properties exhibit long-term fluctuation, which may be critical to predict seizures and to understand pathological conditions of seizure. Of our particular interest is the vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), which may exert modulation in the cortical synchronous activities. VNS is effective not only for seizure inhibition, but also for enhancement of cognitive performance. Thus, by better understanding the mechanism of actions of VNS as well as the mechanisms of seizure, we may gain insights into cortical computation.\t\n\nIntracortical electrode array for ECoG recording\n\nCollaborators\n\n- Prof. Kenske Kawai (Jichi Medical University) (link)\n- Dr. Naoto Kunii (Univ.
