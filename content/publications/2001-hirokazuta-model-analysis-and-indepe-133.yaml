abstract: This paper shows usefulness of the independent component analysis (ICA) on neuronal data acquired with a multiple-site microelectrode. We examine multiple-site auditory evoked potentials measured on rat auditory cortex with our surface microelectrode. We first simulate extracellularly-recorded and grand-averaged signals with Maxwell's equation and Hodgkin & Huxley's model. Then, we apply ICA on experimental data and obtain three independent components. Two of them are considered to be near field potentials and the other far field one; furthermore, one of near field potentials is considered to be caused by firing and another by synaptic activities, because they coincide well with the simulated results.
