abstract: VNS might strengthen the FF pathway through the cholinergic system and attenuate the FB pathway through the noradrenergic system in the auditory cortex. Cortical gain modulation through the VNS-induced neuromodulatory system provides new mechanistic insights into the effect of VNS on auditory processing.
