abstract: AbstractSpatiotemporal patterns of neural activities develop repeatability, diversity, and hierarchy. In the present study, we attempted to elucidate how these dynamical properties are associated with a network structure in primary cultures of dissociated neurons. High‐density CMOS electrode array investigated spatiotemporal activity patterns of dissociated neuronal cultures throughout development. Additionally, based on the spatiotemporal patterns in each test culture, a structure of functional network was estimated with transfer entropy in a pairwise manner. Consequently, repeatability increased with connection strength, dispersity, and clustering at the early developmental stage. Subsequently, hierarchy developed with connection strength and dispersity. These results demonstrated that a repertoire of activity patterns developed with some characteristics of network structure.
