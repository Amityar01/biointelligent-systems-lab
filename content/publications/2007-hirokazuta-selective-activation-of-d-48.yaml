abstract: Neural prostheses for restoring lost functions can benefit from selective activation of nerves with limited number and density of electrodes. Here, we show by simulations and animal experiments that multipoint simultaneous stimulation with a surface electrode array can selectively activate nerves in a bundle at a desired location in between the array or at a desired depth, which are referred to as lateral or depth-wise gating stimulation, respectively. The stimulation broadly generates action potentials with cathodic source electrodes, and simultaneously blocks unnecessary propagation with downstream anodic gate electrodes. In general, stimulation with a small diameter electrode can affect a nearly hemispherical region, while a large electrode is effective at a more vertically compressed region, i.e., a surface of nerve bundle. The gating stimulation takes advantage of the size effects by utilizing an asymmetrical electrode array. The array of the lateral gating stimulation is designed to have four electrodes; a pair of large source electrodes and a pair of small gate electrodes. The depth-wise gating stimulation array consists of two electrodes; a large gate and small source electrodes. The simulation first demonstrated that appropriate combination of currents at the source and gate electrodes can change recruitment patterns of nerves with lateral or depth-wise selectivity as desired. We then applied the lateral gating stimulation on the rat spinal cords and obtained a preliminary support for the feasibility.
