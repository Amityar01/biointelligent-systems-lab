abstract: Auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) in the temporal cortex have typical slow positive/negative (P1/N1) biphasic waves, which are occasionally associated with an additional earlier small deflection (P0/N0). In the present paper, we attempted to address the neural origin of P0/N0 deflection by the independent component analysis (ICA) of densely mapped cortical AEPs of rats. The ICA results suggest that the deflection appears when subcortical contribution to AEP is equal to or larger than cortical contribution.
