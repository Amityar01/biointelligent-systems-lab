abstract: AbstractHere, we describe a novel method for surface passivation of the thin‐film light addressable potentiometric sensor (LAPS). To form a uniform passivation layer, perhydropolysilazane (PHPS) was utilized as a spin‐coatable precursor of silica. After transformation of PHPS into silica by baking, we introduced an O2 plasma treatment aiming for enhancement of the water resistance of the PHPS‐derived silica (PDS) film by completing the PHPS‐to‐silica conversion. To confirm the effect of the O2 plasma treatment, the PDS film was deposited on a thin‐film LAPS electrode and tested by immersion in a cell culturing medium. The immersion test demonstrated that the plasma‐treated PDS film could keep the electrode stable longer than the untreated could. With the treated PSD film of 600 nm in thickness, a lifetime of the thin‐film LAPS was estimated at over 2 weeks, which is sufficient for cell culturing experiments. © 2011 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.
